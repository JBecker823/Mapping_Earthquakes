# Mapping_Earthquakes
Summary of Mapping_Earthquakes challenge 

A nonprofit specializing in weather disaster has requested data visualization for the earthquakes and their location in comparison to the tectonic plates. For this challenge we helped Basil and Sadhana create an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. For the final challenge we mapped the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, with a magnitude greater than 4.5. Using the given GeoJSON file, the maps were created in an HTML link provided through VSCode. By using VSCode and MapBox on a webpage using different visual modes, we were able to map the GeoJSON files using D3.
